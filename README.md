## About
Presented here is a demonstration application crafted with Kotlin. 
It functions by exhibiting a user's GitHub repository catalog upon the input of their user ID. 
Furthermore, it provides insights into individual repositories, including details like forks, open issues, star badge, and more.

## In this branch you'll find
- MVVM Architecture
- A single-activity architecture
- Dependency Injection using Hilt
- Retrofit for network operations
- Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous programming
- Jetpack Navigation for easy navigation between screens
- Clean and Simple Material UI.
- User Interface built with XML
- A set of unit tests for ViewModel and Repository
